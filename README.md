# LLMRobot
This project involves using an LLM with the Makebot mbot2.

## Prerequisites
- An assembled makebot mbot2
- mBlock Python editor
- Download Ignition MQTT broker : https://inductiveautomation.com/downloads/ (You can use any MQTT broker ex: Mosquitto. I like ignition for demos because you can get the full functionality for free. You have to refresh a timer manually every two hours when you are using it which is no problem for demos but cannot be used in production.
